# Windows 10

## **Step 1**: pre-setup

Make sure you **already have** some stuff installed:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on its [defined version](https://github.com/cbelda/angular-environment-setup/blob/master/setup.sh#L5)
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install the CLI of it as well (Command Line Interface)


## **Step 2**: setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cbelda/angular-environment-setup.git
$ cd angular-environment-setup
$ ./setup.sh
```

## **Step 3**: post-setup

The end of the script will prompt both a **Chrome** window/tab with the running app and a **Visual Studio Code** one with the app's code.
